title: "Introduction to Arrays"
teaching: 20
exercises: 20
questions:
- "How do we manage large number of variables?"
objectives:
- "Be able to declare an array of objects given a specific primitive type for these objects."
- "Be able to initialize an array of specific type given the size of the array (how many objects can this array contain)."
- "Be able to initialize elements (objects) of an array that is already initialized." 
- "Be able to manipulate objects (all or individually) inside a given array."
- "Be able to create an appropriate array (size/type) given a specific problem statement."
keypoints:
- "For large number of variables in the same design category (e.g., students in class, 
   courses in a semester ...), we can use a data structure called array to store multiple
   instances of object/primitive of the same type."
