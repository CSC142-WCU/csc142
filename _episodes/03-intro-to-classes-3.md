# 6.6 Overloading Methods and Constructors

Imagine a grocery store. Customers checking out of a grocery store can have at least three 
different ways to pay. They can pay by cash (`numeric`). They can pay by check (`String`). 
They can also pay by credit card (`object`). These different types of payment represent an 
analogy to the concept of **overloading** in object oriented programming. In other words, 
you can **overload** a constructor/method so that this constructor/method can have multiple
definitions with the same name but with different parameters.
