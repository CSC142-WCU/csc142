## Installation of Java

It is most likely that you already have Java installed. To confirm this, first,
open a terminal.

To open a terminal in Windows:
- Click the Start icon on your Windows.
- ...

To open a terminal in Mac, do the followins:
- Click the **magnifier** icon on the top right corner of your Desktop.
- Type **Terminal** into the search window.
- Select the Terminal app.

Next, run `javac -version`

~~~
$ javac -version
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You see the version of Java being displayed on screen. Your version might be
different from mine.

 ~~~
javac 1.8.0_222
 ~~~
 {: .output}

Next, run `java -version`.

~~~
$ java -version
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Similarly, version information will be displayed.

~~~
openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_222-b10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)
~~~

If you do not have **both** `java` and `javac`, you will need to install Java
SDK (Software Development Kit). We will be using the Java distribution maintained
by OpenJDK.

- Go to [OpenJDK website](https://adoptopenjdk.net).
- Choose **OpenJDK 8 (LTS)** for Version and **HotSpot** for JVM.
- Click on the download link to begin download the installation package.
- Run the installer. You can keep all default settings on the installer.
- Once the installation process finishes, carry out the tests above to confirm
that you have both `java` and `javac`.
